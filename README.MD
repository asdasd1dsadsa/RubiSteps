# Installation

## Old-fashion package file

You can execute [this script](/Package/Install.wls) to install [the package file](/Package/RubiSteps.wl), manually also OK.

Note:

* The picture above illustrates this version, not the following paclet version.

* No longer maintained.

## New Paclet

Evaluate the following in Wolfram kernel to install:

`PacletInstall["RubiSteps", "Site" -> "https://github.com/asdasd1dsadsa/RubiSteps/raw/master"]`

**If** not having a good Internet, try to get the latest paclet file from [here](/Paclets/), and then evaluate:

`PacletInstall["the/path/to/the/file.paclet"]`

Note: 

* Perhaps I won't update this too, but at least I intend to.

* Function usage changed. Not same to the old-fashion one.

* Requires Wolfram Kernel with 12.2+ version.
